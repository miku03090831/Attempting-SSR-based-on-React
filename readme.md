use rspack to pack and compile code, let it can run on both server side and browser side
use `pnpm i` to install, and use `pnpm run server` to start the local server, then visit it at localhost:8080

In this stage, we add the client part, to hydrate and make the web page interactive
Additionally, to make it run successfully, I also import Rspack as a bundler
That's all
